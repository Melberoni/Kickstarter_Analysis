# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louise wants to start a crowdfuning campaign for her new play Fever, she has estimated a budget of $10,000. She wants to know if there are specific factors that make a kickstarter campaign successful. We have a dataset of crowdfunding information from the website Kickstarter.  This is broken down into different types of crowdfuning projects and includes variables such as goal amount, pledged amount, country, how many backers and if the project was successfully funded or not.

### Purpose
The purpose is to identify factors that make a kickstarter campaign successful and provide this information to Louise so she can mirror these in her kickstarter.

## Analysis and Challenges
The Challenge was to analize outcomes of different campaigns in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
